	title = {Uniform Beam Distributions at the Target of the {NSRL} Beam Transfer Line},
	abstract = {The {NASA} {SPACE} {RADIATION} {LABORATORY} ({NSRL}) has been constructed and started operations at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2003. The {NSRL} facility will be used by {NASA} to conduct radiation effect studies on materials and biological samples for the space program. The {NSRL} facility utilizes proton and heavy-ion beams of energies from 50 to 3000 {MeV}/n which are accelerated by the {AGS}\_Booster synchrotron accelerator. To date, protons, 12C, 56Fe, 48Ti ion beams of various magnetic rigidities have been transported to the sample location which is located 100 m downstream from the beginning of the {NSRL} line. The {NSRL} beam transport line has been designed to employ octupole magnetic elements[1] which transform the normal (Gaussian) beam distribution at the location of the sample into a beam with rectangular cross section, and uniformly distributed over the rectangle. To obtain the uniform beam distribution on the sample, no beam-collimation is applied at any location along the {NSRL} beam transport line and the beam focusing at the location of the sample is purely magnetic. In this technical note we present data from the beam distribution at the target when the octupoles are excited, and compare the beam distributions with octupoles turned off, and the effects of beam misalignments on the beam uniformity at the target will be discussed along with the correction methods used. Future developments on obtaining uniform beams will also be discussed.},

The algorithms are described such that they can be readily implemented in magnetohydrodynamics codes or Particle-in-Cell codes. Our comparison focuses on the strengths and key features of the particle integrators. We test the conservation of invariants of motion and the accuracy of particle drift dynamics in highly relativistic, mildly relativistic, and non-relativistic settings. The methods are compared in idealized test cases, i.e., without considering feedback onto the electrodynamic fields, collisions, pair creation, or radiation. The test cases include uniform electric and magnetic fields, fields, force-free fields, and setups relevant for high-energy astrophysics, e.g., a magnetic mirror, a magnetic dipole, and a magnetic null.

	abstract = {Abstract
            {GaToroid} is a concept of toroidal gantry for hadron therapy under investigation at {CERN} It makes use of the toroidal magnetic field between each pair of coils to steer and focus the particle beams down to the patient. This peculiar concept requires detailed studies on particle tracking and beam optics to optimise the winding geometry and explore the properties of the system. The work presented in this manuscript is focused on the features of a {GaToroid} system for protons, specifically designed to minimise the footprint and weight of the gantry. Firstly, a two-dimensional single particle tracking was developed to optimise the coil geometry and the toroidal magnetic field, aiming to the maximisation of the energy acceptance of the magnet. Particles over the whole spectrum of treatment energy are directed at isocenter within 1 mm of precision. This procedure, restricted to the symmetry plane between each pair of coils, defines different beam orbits, function of the beam energy. Subsequently, a three-dimensional particle tracking was implemented to evaluate the interaction of a beam of finite dimensions with the complete magnetic field map in vacuum. The parameters of the simulated beam at the isocenter are coherent with the clinical requirements. The results of the three-dimensional tracking were then used to calculate the linear transfer matrix associated to each beam orbit. Finally, the option of performing the beam spot scanning at the isocenter by acting on the upstream steering magnet has been investigated, highlighting the potential of the concept, as well as the limitations related to the scanning field dimension and source-to-axis distance. In conclusion, the results described in this paper represent a crucial step toward the understanding of the beam optics properties of a {GaToroid} gantry.},

Specifically, the outcomes of the first {UHE} heavy ion test campaign carried out at the {CHARM} facility are presented and discussed in this contribution. {UHE} ion beams have the advantage of not requiring a previous modification of the samples or testing in vacuum, owing to their large penetration range. The unique nature of the {UHE} ions motivated the study of their interaction with matter, with regard to the induction of {SEE}. To that end, great effort was paid on the calibration of the beam line instrumentation, typically prepared for the traditional proton runs. Electronic components sensitive to single event upset ({SEU}) and single-event latchup ({SEL}) were irradiated by an {UHE} xenon beam, with a particular interest in studying the sub-{LET} cross section region and benchmarking against the standard heavy ion test beams.

For that purpose, field maps of the magnet have been measured for the various operational current settings. They include the central field, the end stray field and the lateral stray field. In order to get a functional form which can be inserted in the equations of motion for a charged particle in a magnetic field, the discrete field maps are converted into bi-dimensional polynomials of degree up to fourteen. These equations can be written as a set of four first order differential equations which are solved simultaneously. Two of them are non-linear and describe the centroid motion, the other two are linear and apply to the betatron motion.

	abstract = {The {CERN} Proton Synchrotron machine is built using combined function magnets. The control of the linear tune as well as the chromaticity in both planes is achieved by means of special coils added to the main magnets, namely two pole-face-windings and one ﬁgure-of-eight loop. As a result, the overall magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is rather complex not to mention the saturation effects induced at top-energy. For these reasons a linear model of the {PS} main magnet does not provide sufﬁcient precision to model particle dynamics. On the other hand, a sophisticated optical model is the key element for the foreseen intensity upgrade and, in particular, for the novel extraction mode based on adiabatic capture of beam particles inside stable islands in transverse phase space. A solution was found by performing accurate measurement of the nonlinear tune as a function of both amplitude and momentum offset so to extract both linear and nonlinear properties of the lattice. In this paper the measurement results are presented and the derived optical model is discussed in detail.},

In this paper, we discuss data collected on the uniform beam distributions produced for {NASA}’s Space Radiation Laboratory ({NSRL}) at Brookhaven National Laboratory ({BNL}), using a method that was conceived theoretically and tested experimentally at {BNL}. This method [N. Tsoupas et al., Nucl. Sci. Eng. 126, 71 (1997)] of generating uniform beam distributions on a plane normal to the beam’s direction relies only on magnetically focusing the transported beam; no collimation of the beam is required or any other type of interaction of the beam with materials other than the target material. The method compares favorably with alternative methods of producing such distributions, and it can be applied to the entire energy spectrum of charged particle beams that are delivered to the {NSRL}’s experiments by the Booster for the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at {BNL}.},

	abstract = {The {PS} primary proton beam is slowly extracted at 24 {GeV}/c towards the East Area with the help of the third- order resonance technique over a typical spill length of 350 to 450 ns within 2.4 s cycles. The number of East Area extractions is usually around five to six per overall {PS} super-cycle of typically 40 s and depends on both users and schedule constraints, respectively. After passing both magnetic septa {SMH}57 and {SMH}61 in the {PS}, the beam enters the F61 transfer line that transports the beam either to the so-called North Targets via the lines F62 and F63 or towards T08, which serves the irradiation facilities {IRRAD} and {CHARM}. During operation of primary ion beams, only these irradiation facilities can be operated. The principle of extraction by third-order resonance and the corresponding optical elements inside the {PS}, such as the magnetic septa, will be kept unchanged for the new East Area operation. Thus, only a replacement of the existing magnets by laminated versions with slight optimization of the optics was chosen as the renovation baseline for F61 with changes in the layout mostly due to integration constraints and considerations for improved radiation protection. In particular, all the main horizontal bends have been replaced by reliable and robust {MCB} magnets, which are available with sufficient spares and can be operated in pulsed mode. The splitting option, although more efficient for operation, was dropped in 2005 for technical reasons that were hard to overcome in a reliable manner. For further details on the recent operational history of F61 and the original ideas of the renovated East Area beams.},

	abstract = {The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, and not including the gravitational force) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world,  with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.  Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.
Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe as possibly described by dark energy.  The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.
The development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of phenomena including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.},

	abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, ﬁgures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Uniﬁed Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology. Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the {PDG} Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, ﬁgures, and equations from selected review articles is also available.},

The particles created in this process (the final state) must each be less massive than the original, although the total invariant mass of the system must be conserved. A particle is unstable if there is at least one allowed final state that it can decay into. Unstable particles will often have multiple ways of decaying, each with its own associated probability. Decays are mediated by one or several fundamental forces. The particles in the final state may themselves be unstable and subject to further decay.
The term is typically distinct from radioactive decay, in which an unstable atomic nucleus is transformed into a lighter nucleus accompanied by the emission of particles or radiation, although the two are conceptually similar and are often described using the same terminology.},

The rotating pattern of permanent magnets (on the front face; on the left, up, right, down) can be continued indefinitely and have the same effect. The effect of this arrangement is roughly similar to many horseshoe magnets placed adjacent to each other, with similar poles touching.
The effect was discovered by John C. Mallinson in 1973, and these "one-sided flux" structures were initially described by him as a "curiosity", although at the time he recognized from this discovery the potential for significant improvements in magnetic tape technology.Physicist Klaus Halbach, while at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during the 1980s, independently invented the Halbach array to focus particle accelerator beams.},

	title = {{FASER}: {CERN} approves new experiment to look for long-lived, exotic particles},
	url = {https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/faser-cern-approves-new-experiment-look-long-lived-exotic-particles},
	shorttitle = {{FASER}},
	abstract = {Geneva. Today, the {CERN} Research Board approved a new experiment designed to look for light and weakly interacting particles at the {LHC}. {FASER}, or the Forward Search Experiment, will complement {CERN}’s ongoing physics programme, extending its discovery potential to several new particles. Some of these sought-after particles are associated with dark matter, which is a hypothesised kind of matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic force and consequently cannot be directly detected using emitted light. Astrophysical evidence shows that dark matter makes up about 27\% of the universe, but it has never been observed and studied in a laboratory.

With an expanding interest in undiscovered particles, particularly long-lived particles and dark matter, new experiments have been proposed to expand the scientific potential of {CERN}’s accelerator complex and infrastructure as part of the Physics Beyond Collider ({PBC}) study, under whose aegis {FASER} operates. “This novel experiment helps diversify the physics programme of colliders such as the {LHC}, and allows us to address unanswered questions in particle physics from a different perspective,” explains Mike Lamont, co-coordinator of the {PBC} study group.

The four main {LHC} detectors are not suited for detecting the light and weakly interacting particles that might be produced parallel to the beam line. They may travel hundreds of metres without interacting with any material before transforming into known and detectable particles, such as electrons and positrons. The exotic particles would escape the existing detectors along the current beam lines and remain undetected. {FASER} will therefore be located along the beam trajectory 480 metres downstream from the interaction point within {ATLAS}. Although the protons in the particle beams will be bent by magnets around the {LHC}, the light, very weakly interacting particles will continue along a straight line and their “decay products” can be spotted by {FASER}. The potential new particles would be very collimated with the beam, spreading out very little, therefore allowing a relatively small and inexpensive detector to perform highly sensitive searches.

The detector’s total length is under 5 metres and its core cylindrical structure has a radius of 10 centimetres. It will be installed in a side tunnel along an unused transfer line which links the {LHC} to its injector, the Super Proton Synchrotron. To allow {FASER} to be constructed in a quick and affordable way, it will use spare detector parts kindly donated from the {ATLAS} and {LHCb} experiments. The collaboration of 16 institutes that is building the detector and will carry out the experiments is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation and the Simons Foundation.

{FASER} will search for a suite of hypothesised particles including so-called “dark photons”, particles which are associated with dark matter, neutralinos and others. The experiment will be installed during the ongoing Long Shutdown 2 and start taking data from {LHC}’s Run 3 between 2021 and 2023.

“It is very exciting to have {FASER} approved for installation at {CERN}. It is amazing how the collaboration has come together so quickly and we are looking forward to recording our first data when the {LHC} starts up again in 2021,” says Jamie Boyd, co-spokesperson of the {FASER} experiment.

“{FASER} is a neat physics proposal that addresses a particular aspect in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model and I am pleased to see it being implemented so efficiently,” adds Eckhard Elsen, {CERN}’s Director for Research and Computing.},

	abstract = {Concentrates have advantages of high ferrous grade, less harmful impurities and lower price. However, the small size and poor granulation behavior of concentrates could deteriorate the permeability of the sinter bed and reduce sinter productivity, thus making it difficult to use concentrates effectively. Therefore, in order to strengthen the granulation behavior of concentrates, granulation experiments were carried out and experiment samples made with one kind of concentrates and five kinds of fine iron ores were produced in this paper. Then, the effects of water absorbility and wettability of fine iron ores on granulation behavior of concentrates were investigated. Furthermore, optimized ore blending recipes were proposed to strengthen the granulation behavior of concentrates by sinter pot tests. Results show that the granulation behavior of concentrates was improved for the samples exhibiting high maximum capillary water and small contact angle in fine iron ores. Compared with the scheme of blending ores containing 15 mass\% concentrate, the growth index of quasi-particles increased by 20.62\% in the case of iron ore {BR}-2 replacing half of iron ore {BR}-1, the vertical sintering speed went up from 26.32 to 29.26 mm min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, the productivity increased from 1.95 to 2.20 t m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The growth index of the quasi-particles increased by 30\% when using iron ore {AR}-2 to replace half of iron ore {AR}-1. The vertical sintering speed and the productivity of sinter improved to 29.82 mm min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and 2.24 t m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, respectively. The results help to improve the granulation behavior of concentrates by optimizing the blending ore recipes, based on the characteristics of fine iron ores, and thus use these concentrates more efficiently in the sintering process.},

Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of uncertain origin. Data from the Fermi Space Telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernova explosions of stars. Active galactic nuclei are also theorized to produce cosmic rays.},

	abstract = {Bremsstrahlung (German pronunciation: [ˈbʁɛmsˌʃtʁaːlʊŋ] ( listen)), from bremsen "to brake" and Strahlung "radiation"; i.e., "braking radiation" or "deceleration radiation", is electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus. The moving particle loses kinetic energy, which is converted into radiation, i.e. a photon, thus satisfying the law of conservation of energy. The term is also used to refer to the process of producing the radiation. Bremsstrahlung has a continuous spectrum, which becomes more intense and whose peak intensity shifts toward higher frequencies as the change of the energy of the decelerated particles increases.
Broadly speaking, bremsstrahlung or braking radiation is any radiation produced due to the deceleration (negative acceleration) of a charged particle, which includes synchrotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a relativistic particle), cyclotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a non-relativistic particle), and the emission of electrons and positrons during beta decay. However, the term is frequently used in the more narrow sense of radiation from electrons (from whatever source) slowing in matter.
Bremsstrahlung emitted from plasma is sometimes referred to as free/free radiation. This refers to the fact that the radiation in this case is created by charged particles that are free; i.e., not part of an ion, atom or molecule, both before and after the deflection (acceleration) that caused the emission.},

	abstract = {Antimatter nuclei in cosmic rays ({CR}) represent a promising discovery channel for the indirect search of dark matter. We present astrophysical background calculations of {CR} antideuteron (\${\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\$) and antihelium (\${\textbackslash}overline\{He\}\$). These particles are produced by high-energy collisions of {CR} protons and nuclei with the gas nuclei of the interstellar medium. In our calculations, we also consider production and shock acceleration of antinuclei in the shells of supernova remnants ({SNRs}). The total flux of \${\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}overline\{He\}\$ particles is constrained using new {AMS} measurements on the boron/carbon (B/C) and antiproton/proton (\${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}/p\$) ratios. The two ratios leads to different antiparticle fluxes in the high-energy regime \$E{\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 10 {GeV}/n where, in particular, \${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}/p\$-driven calculations leads to a significantly larger antiparticle flux in comparison to predictions from conventional B/C-driven constraints. On the other hand, both approaches provide consistent results in the sub-{GeV}/n energy window, which is where dark matter induced signal may exceed the astrophysical background. In this region, the total antinuclei flux, from interaction in the insterstellar gas and inside {SNRs}, is tightly bounded by the data. Shock-acceleration of antiparticles in {SNRs} has a minor influence in the astrophysical background for dark matter searches.},

	abstract = {Sir Isaac Newton (; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the Solar System and demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's theoretical prediction that the Earth is shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, thus convincing most Continental European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over the earlier system of Descartes. Newton also built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves. Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian, who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and who, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and he spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1700) and Master (1700–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).},

La notion d’« intrication », en particulier, explorée depuis une trentaine d’années, mène à l’existence, très contre-intuitive, d’un hasard ubiquitaire, capable de se manifester simultanément en plusieurs endroits de notre univers…Cette stupéfiante « non-localité » n’est pas une abstraction gratuite ou un jeu de l’esprit ; elle a des applications bien concrètes en cryptographie, pour la protection des données financières et médicales, et a permis la démonstration d’une « téléportation quantique » dont les auteurs de science-fiction les plus imaginatifs ont du mal à entrevoir les infinies possibilités.À l’opposé de la littérature ordinaire sur le sujet, ce petit livre ne tente pas de contourner les réelles difficultés logiques imposées par la physique quantique.

	abstract = {Sir Isaac Newton  (; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.
Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the Solar System and demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's theoretical prediction that the Earth is shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, thus convincing most Continental European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over the earlier system of Descartes.
Newton also built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.
Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian, who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and who, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and he spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1700) and Master (1700–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).},

	abstract = {Explication du monde à très petite échelle, monde peuplé d’atomes et de photons, la physique quantique n’est pas avare de propriétés singulières. À notre échelle, la supraconductivité, les lasers et l’effet tunnel résultent de phénomènes quantiques. Mais cette science a aussi des implications plus fondamentales, qui constituent de véritables défis à la logique ordinaire. La notion d’« intrication », en particulier, explorée depuis une trentaine d’années, mène à l’existence, très contre-intuitive, d’un hasard ubiquitaire, capable de se manifester simultanément en plusieurs endroits de notre univers…Cette stupéfiante « non-localité » n’est pas une abstraction gratuite ou un jeu de l’esprit ; elle a des applications bien concrètes en cryptographie, pour la protection des données financières et médicales, et a permis la démonstration d’une « téléportation quantique » dont les auteurs de science-fiction les plus imaginatifs ont du mal à entrevoir les infinies possibilités.À l’opposé de la littérature ordinaire sur le sujet, ce petit livre ne tente pas de contourner les réelles difficultés logiques imposées par la physique quantique. De « jeu de Bell » en expériences d’intrication quantique, il mène vers une solide compréhension d’un des domaines les plus fascinants de la physique actuelle.Physicien théoricien, directeur du département de physique appliquée de l’Université de Genève, Nicolas Gisin est un pionnier de la téléportation et de l’informatique quantiques. Il est cofondateur de la société {ID} Quantique, leader mondial en cryptographie quantique. Il a reçu en 2009 le premier prix John Stewart Bell.},
